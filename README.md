# Water Buffalo

Water Buffalo is a Java port of the Ruby Capybara library.
It acts as a convenience layer between Selenium (WebDriver) and Cucumber.


## Tests

A set of JUnit tests is provided in the `tests` directory.
The tests use Selenium and Firefox to run the tests.
Please note that the tests may not run if you do not have Internet connectivity.
(On Firefox on Mac OS X, Firefox would start up in Offline mode, and would not load any pages.)
